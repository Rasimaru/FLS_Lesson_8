						<h2>What are the best things to do in Toronto?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="entry-text">
						<p>There are many cultural things to do in Toronto, it being a lively, cosmopolitan city, and one of the most popular destinations in Canada. It’s has a famous music scene, an extremely varied dining scene and many unique neighbourhoods, all clustered around the Old Town. Torontonians are also keen on their sports, with the city coming to life on game days – around the baseball ground in the summer and the ice hockey stadium in the winter.</p>
						<p>Visitors to Toronto will find plenty of historical buildings, dramatic scenery and great shopping, but it’s also a city of hidden treasures and secret nooks. With a convenient subway system and excellent bus and street car services, there’s plenty of opportunity to explore. </p>

						</div>
						<div class="section-text">
							<p>Fort York played quite an important role in the early years of the city of Toronto. It was built in 1793 to protect the fledgling settlement and was then destroyed during the Battle of York, in the War of 1812. However, it was quickly rebuilt to protect the town of York from future raids. The site is now home to Canada’s largest collection of buildings from the period, allowing visitors a glimpse back into history. Visit in summer for the best experience, when you’ll see special events and exhibits, including reenactors in military uniforms of the time.</p>

							<p>Torontonians love their sports, with ice hockey naturally among the most popular. The Hockey Hall of Fame is the home of the Stanley Cup – the sport’s most coveted prize – as well as a huge range of exhibits. These include a to-scale recreation of the Montreal Canadiens dressing room and seemingly endless items of hockey memorabilia and equipment. The Great Hall is the real highlight, though, and features the names and histories of some of the sport’s greatest stars.</p>

							<p>Despite being built between 1911 and 1914, Casa Loma has the look of an 18th-century Gothic Revival castle. It was originally an ostentatious show of wealth, created by the man who built the first hydro-electric plant on the Niagara River. It’s now a museum, landmark and popular venue for wedding ceremonies, thanks to its beautiful 5-acre gardens, which are open from May to the end of October. Self-guided audio tours of the 98-room castle and its grounds are available in several languages.</p>
